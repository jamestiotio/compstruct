## Future Addons

- Implement a one-round partial/half DES encryption algorithm on a 32-bit plaintext (and a 32-bit key) and verify the ciphertext by using BSim on the Beta simulator. It will not be a full triple-DES, 16-rounds-each implementation, but for the sake of a model demonstration as in this case, it should be fine.
- Implement a general-purpose 32-bit CPU processor architecture, complete with its own associated memory unit in Lucid (or Verilog).
- Add demo program of a method to draw animations/videos frame-by-frame on the BSim render window
